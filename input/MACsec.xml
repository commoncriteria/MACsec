  <sec:Introduction>
    <sec:Overview>
      The scope of this Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) is to describe the security functionality of Media Access Control Security (MACsec) encryption in terms of the Common Criteria [CC] 
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base Protection Profiles (Base-PPs):
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>collaborative Protection Profile for
          Network Devices, Version 2.2e (NDcPP)</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      <h:p>
      This Base-PP is valid because a device that implements MACsec encryption is a specific type of network device, 
      and there is nothing about the implementation of MACsec that would prevent any of the security capabilities defined by the Base-PP from being satisfied.
      </h:p><h:p>
      A Target of Evaluation (TOE) that conforms to a PP-Configuration containing this PP-Module may be a ‘Distributed TOE’ as defined in the NDcPP. 
      This PP-Module does not prohibit the TOE from implementing other security functionality in a distributed manner. 
      For example, a TOE may be deployed in such a manner that distributed nodes establish MACsec connectivity with physically separated networks 
      while a centralized management device is used to configure the behavior of individual nodes.

      <h:p>
      This PP-Module specifically addresses MACsec, which allows authorized systems using Ethernet Transport to maintain confidentiality of transmitted data 
      and to take measures against frames that are transmitted or modified by unauthorized devices.
      </h:p><h:p>
      MACsec protects communication between trusted components of the network infrastructure, thus protecting the network operation. 
      It facilitates maintenance of correct network connectivity and services as well as isolation of denial of service attacks.
      </h:p><h:p>
      The hardware, firmware, and software of the MACsec device define the physical boundary. 
      All of the security functionality is contained and executed within the physical boundary of the device. 
      For example, given a device with an Ethernet card, the whole device is considered to be within the boundary.
      </h:p><h:p>
      Since this PP-Module builds on the NDcPP, conformant TOEs are obligated to implement the functionality required in the NDcPP along with 
      the additional functionality defined in this PP-Module in response to the threat environment discussed later in this document. 
      </h:p>
    </sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        The physical boundary for a TOE that conforms to this PP-Module is a hardware appliance that also provides generalized network device functionality, 
        such as auditing, I&amp;A, and cryptographic services for network communications. 
        The TOE’s logical boundary includes all functionality required by the claimed Base-PP as well as the MACsec functionality 
        and related capabilities that are defined in this PP-Module. 
        Any functionality that is provided by the network device that is not relevant to the security requirements defined by this PP-Module 
        or the Base-PP is considered to be outside the scope of the TOE.
      </sec:TOE_Boundary>
    
    
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      <h:p>
      A pair of MACsec devices connected by a physical medium can protect Ethernet frames switched or routed from one device to the other. 
      The two MACsec devices are provided with a CAK and use the MKA protocol to create a secure tunnel. 
      MKA is used by the two MACsec devices to agree upon MACsec keys. 
      A policy should be installed to protect traffic between the devices, with the exception of the MKA or Ethernet control traffic such as 
      Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) over LAN (EAPOL) frames.
      </h:p><h:p>
      This PP-Module defines two potential use cases for the MACsec TOE.

          <description>
            MACsec can be deployed in a hop by hop manner between Ethernet devices.  
            Two devices will protect traffic originating in protected networks traversing an untrusted link between them. 
            The devices will first exchange MKA frames, which serve to determine the peer is an authorized peer, 
            and agree upon a shared key and MACsec ciphersuite used to set up a transmit (Tx) SA and a receive (Rx) SA. 
            Once the SAs are set up, MACsec-protected frames traverse the unprotected link.

            In some markets network service providers have standardized their offerings according to various versions of the MEF specifications.  
            One recent MEF specification is the “E-Line” (*) service type which is based on the use of point-to-point (P2P) Ethernet Virtual Circuits. 
            A port-based service is known as an EPL and a VLAN-based service is known as an EVPL. 
            EPL provides a P2P Ethernet virtual connection between a pair of dedicated user–network interfaces (UNIs), 
            with a high degree of transparency. EVPL provides a P2P or point-to-multipoint connection between UNIs.  
            A difference between the EVPL and EPL is the degree of transparency - while EPL is highly transparent, filtering only the pause frames, 
            EVPL is required to either peer or drop most of the Layer 2 Control Protocols.  The MEF has also defined other service types such as E-LAN and E-Tree.

            </h:p><h:p>
            A MACsec device may sit on the periphery of a network, which means that it may have an externally-facing interface to a public network. 
            Devices located in the public network may attempt to exercise services located on the internal network that are intended to be accessed 
            only from within the internal network or externally accessible only from specifically authorized devices.

            these devices on the internal network may be subject to compromise. 
            Similarly, if two MACsec devices are deployed to facilitate end-to-end encryption of traffic that is contained within a single network, 
            an attacker could use an insecure MACsec device as a method to access devices on a specific segment of that network such as an individual LAN.

          FIA_AFL_EXT.1 has a dependency on FIA_UAU.1 because the notion of authentication failure handling implies the existence of an authentication mechanism.
          This dependency is addressed by a conformant TOE through the Base-PP requirement FIA_UAU_EXT.2, which defines authentication mechanisms specific to network devices.

    For a distributed TOE, the SFRs in this PP-Module need to be met by the
    TOE as a whole, but not all SFRs will necessarily be implemented by all components. The
    following categories are defined in order to specify when each SFR must be implemented by a
    component: <h:ul>
      <h:li><h:b>All Components ("All"):</h:b> All components that comprise the distributed TOE must
        independently satisfy the requirement.</h:li>
      <h:li><h:b>At least one Component ("One"):</h:b> This requirement must be fulfilled by at least one
        component within the distributed TOE.</h:li>
      <h:li><h:b>Feature Dependent ("Feature Dependent"):</h:b> These requirements will only be
        fulfilled where the feature is implemented by the distributed TOE component (note
        that the requirement to meet the PP-Module as a whole requires that at least one component
        implements these requirements if they are claimed by the TOE).</h:li></h:ul>

    The TOE does not require any additional supplementary information to describe its entropy source beyond the requirements outlined in the Base-PP. 
    As with other Base-PP requirements, the only additional requirement is that the entropy documentation also applies to the specific 
    MACsec Ethernet encryption capabilities of the TOE that require random data, in addition to any functionality required by the Base-PP.
