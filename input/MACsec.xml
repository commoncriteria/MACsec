  <sec:Introduction>
    <sec:Overview>
      The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of Media Access Control Security (MACsec) encryption in terms of [CC] 
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>collaborative Protection Profile for
          Network Devices, Version 2.2e (NDcPP)</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      <h:p>
      This Base-PP is valid because a device that implements MACsec encryption is a specific type of network device, 
      and there is nothing about the implementation of MACsec that would prevent any of the security capabilities defined by the Base-PP from being satisfied.
      </h:p><h:p>
      A TOE that conforms to a PP-Configuration containing this PP-Module may be a ‘Distributed TOE’ as defined in the NDcPP. 
      This PP-Module does not prohibit the TOE from implementing other security functionality in a distributed manner. 
      For example, a TOE may be deployed in such a manner that distributed nodes establish MACsec connectivity with physically separated networks 
      while a centralized management device is used to configure the behavior of individual nodes.

    <sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      <h:p>
      This PP-Module specifically addresses MACsec, which allows authorized systems using Ethernet Transport to maintain confidentiality of transmitted data 
      and to take measures against frames that are transmitted or modified by unauthorized devices.
      </h:p><h:p>
      MACsec protects communication between trusted components of the network infrastructure, thus protecting the network operation. 
      It facilitates maintenance of correct network connectivity and services as well as isolation of denial of service attacks.
      </h:p><h:p>
      The hardware, firmware, and software of the MACsec device define the physical boundary. 
      All of the security functionality is contained and executed within the physical boundary of the device. 
      For example, given a device with an Ethernet card, the whole device is considered to be within the boundary.
      </h:p><h:p>
      Since this PP-Module builds on the NDcPP, conformant TOEs are obligated to implement the functionality required in the NDcPP along with 
      the additional functionality defined in this PP-Module in response to the threat environment discussed later in this document. 
      </h:p>
    </sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        The physical boundary for a TOE that conforms to this PP-Module is a hardware appliance that also provides generalized network device functionality, 
        such as auditing, I&amp;A, and cryptographic services for network communications. 
        The TOE’s logical boundary includes all functionality required by the claimed Base-PP as well as the MACsec functionality 
        and related capabilities that are defined in this PP-Module. 
        Any functionality that is provided by the network device that is not relevant to the security requirements defined by this PP-Module 
        or the Base-PP is considered to be outside the scope of the TOE.
      </sec:TOE_Boundary>
    
    
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      <h:p>
      A pair of MACsec devices connected by a physical medium can protect Ethernet frames switched or routed from one device to the other. 
      The two MACsec devices are provided with a Connectivity Association Key (CAK) and utilize the MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) protocol to create a secure tunnel. 
      MKA is used by the two MACsec devices to agree upon MACsec keys. 
      A policy should be installed to protect traffic between the devices, with the exception of the MKA or Ethernet control traffic such as EAP over LAN (EAPOL) frames.
      </h:p><h:p>
      This PP-Module defines two potential use cases for the MACsec TOE.
      </h:p>

        <usecase id="usecase-hopbyhop" title="Classic Hop by Hop Deployment">
          <description>
            MACsec can be deployed in a hop by hop manner between Ethernet devices.  
            Two devices will protect traffic originating in protected networks traversing an untrusted link between them. 
            The devices will first exchange MKA frames, which serve to determine the peer is an authorized peer, 
            and agree upon a shared key and MACsec cipher suite used to set up a transmit (Tx) Secure Association (SA) and a receive (Rx) SA. 
            Once the SAs are set up, MACsec-protected frames traverse the unprotected link.

            <h:p>
            In some markets network service providers have standardized their offerings according to various versions of the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) specifications.  
            One recent MEF specification is the “E-Line” (*) service type which is based on the use of point to point Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs). 
            A port based service is known as an Ethernet Private Line and a VLAN based service is known as an Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL). 
            EPL provides a point-to-point Ethernet virtual connection (EVC) between a pair of dedicated user–network interfaces (UNIs), 
            with a high degree of transparency. EVPL provides a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connection between UNIs.  
            A difference between the EVPL and EPL is the degree of transparency - while EPL is highly transparent, filtering only the pause frames, 
            EVPL is required to either peer or drop most of the Layer 2 Control Protocols.  The MEF has also defined other service types such as E-LAN and E-Tree.

            </h:p><h:p>
            A MACsec device may sit on the periphery of a network, which means that it may have an externally-facing interface to a public network. 
            Devices located in the public network may attempt to exercise services located on the internal network that are intended to be accessed 
            only from within the internal network or externally accessible only from specifically authorized devices. 
            If the MACsec device allows unauthorized external devices access to the internal network, 
            these devices on the internal network may be subject to compromise. 
            Similarly, if two MACsec devices are deployed to facilitate end-to-end encryption of traffic that is contained within a single network, 
            an attacker could use an insecure MACsec device as a method to access devices on a specific segment of that network such as an individual LAN.

	        The Base-PP iteration of the SFR also requires “all administrative actions” to be audited. When the TOE includes this PP-Module,

    <TSS>The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it identifies the TOE’s auditable events. 
      If the TOE is distributed across multiple components, the evaluator shall also ensure that the TSS identifies the component that is responsible for each type of auditable event.
      <h:p/></TSS>
    <Guidance>The evaluator shall check the operational guidance and ensure that it lists all of the auditable events and provides a format for audit records. 
      Each audit record format type must be covered, along with a brief description of each field. 
      The evaluator shall check to make sure that every audit event type mandated by the PP-Module 
      and claimed in the ST is described, and that the description of the fields contains the 
      information required in FAU_GEN.1.2/SBC and the additional information specified in the Auditable Events table of the PP-Module.
      <h:p/>
      If the TOE’s default configuration does not include all required auditable events, 
      the evaluator shall check the operational guidance to ensure that it includes instructions on how to place the TOE into its evaluated configuration by ensuring that all required auditable events are generated.
      <h:p/></Guidance>
    <Tests>
      The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the TOE generate audit records 
      in accordance with the EAs associated with the functional requirements in the PP-Module. 
      Additionally, the evaluator shall test that each administrative action applicable in the context of the PP-Module is auditable. 
      When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the operational guidance, 
      and that the fields in each audit record have the proper entries. 
      <h:p/>
      Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms directly. 
      For example, the testing that is performed to ensure that the operational guidance provided is correct will verify that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied 
      and should address the invocation of the administrative actions that are needed to verify the audit records are generated as expected.

			    This SFR defines additional management functions for the TOE beyond what is defined in the Base-PP as FMT_SMF.1. 
			    The TOE may have all management functionality implemented in the same logical interface; 
			    it is not necessary for “network device management” and “SBC management” to be implemented in separate interfaces.
			    <h:p/>
			    This PP-Module may rely on management functionality defined in the Base-PP to support the implementation of its functions. 
			    For example, the SBC portion of the TOE relies on the reliable time function that must be implemented by the Base-PP portion of the TOE. 
			    If the Base-PP implements this using NTP, the “Ability to set the time which is used for time-stamps” or “Ability to configure NTP” 
			    management function defined in FMT_SMF.1 in the Base-PP can be used to address this PP-Module’s dependency on reliable system time.
			    Note that support for NTP is recommended but not required.
			    <h:p/>
			    The 'configurable auditable events' function relates to FAU_SEL.1, specifically with respect to allowing a Security Administrator 
			    to determine whether a given event is auditable. As this refers to the events for the triggering of various filtering rules, 
			    it may be implicitly addressed through the ‘configure traffic filtering rules’ function, 
			    for example by explicitly defining a rule with a type that automatically requires it to be logged or a parameter that causes it to be logged if triggered.

			    The evaluator shall review the guidance documentation to determine that each of the functions detailed in the TSS are identified,

			  <Tests>
			    For each management function specified in FMT_SMF.1.1/SBC, the evaluator shall access the TOE with appropriate authorizations, 
			    perform the required function, and demonstrate that configuration of the function results in the proper expected behavior. 
			    For behavior related to SBC functionality (as opposed to manipulation of user accounts), this may be tested in conjunction with other SFRs.
			    <h:p/>
			    The evaluator shall also ensure that all relevant management functionality from FMT_SMF.1 in the Base-PP that relates to the SBC PP-Module are tested in conjunction with SBC functionality. 
			    For example, for SBC functions that rely on time services, 
			    the evaluator shall ensure that a Security Administrator can either manually configure the time or specify NTP server connectivity and ensure that the SBC functions will make use of the configured time data.
			    <h:p/>
			    The evaluator shall also demonstrate that a user who lacks privileges to execute these functions (as described in the operational guidance) are unable to execute them.

          FDP_IFF.1 has a dependency on FMT_MSA.3 to define the default security posture of security attributes for the purpose of information flow control enforcement. 
          This SFR has not been defined by this PP-Module because the enforcement of FDP_IFF.1 
          is not dependent on the initial state of security attributes. 
          For example, FDP_IFF.1.2 requires the TSF to determine if a communication attempt is valid before authorizing it. 
          This is true regardless of whether the default value of security attributes associated 
          with the connection attempt are permissive or restrictive; there is no difference in how the TSF determines “validity” in this case. 
          <h:p/>
          The default values of security attributes do not cause the information flow control policy to behave differently for those rules that must always be enforced by the TSF. 
          FDP_IFF.1.4 requires that all allowlisted calling parties be authorized while all denylisted calling parties be rejected. 
          It does not matter for the purpose of enforcing this SFR whether the absence of a calling party from both the allowlist and the denylist means they are authorized or rejected by default.
